## Common Searching Algorithms:
1. Linear Search:
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Simple approach that checks each element sequentially
- useful for unsorted arrays

2. Binary Search:
- Time Complexity: O(logn)
- works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search space in half

3. Depth-first search: (DFS)
- Used for traversing graph/tree structures
- explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking
- often implemented using recursion or stack

4. Breadth-first Search: (BFS)
- explores all neighbours present depth moving to nodes at the next depth level
- implemented using queue
- optimal for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs
